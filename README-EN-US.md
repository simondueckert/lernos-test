Nuremberg Castle is located north of the Pegnitz River on a sandstone ridge above the old town of Sebald. In the west it borders on the Neutorgraben, in the north on the Vestnertorgraben. Towards the north, the castle is part of the Nuremberg city fortifications. From the castle there is a view of the craftsmen's quarter below it and the Old Town. The site was well chosen for a defensive location. The rocky castle sandstone ridge running parallel to the Pegnitz valley near the northern lower terrace slopes steeply to the south, west and north, making it ideal for a castle in a spur position. Its relief energy is significant: to the 351 m high summit, the 320 m isohypse approaches 50 m in the south, 200 m in the west and north, while it swings out 1300 m to the east. Moreover, the place probably belonged to the king's land and was situated between the old king's court Altdorf with its offshoot Mögeldorf and the king's court Fürth.
